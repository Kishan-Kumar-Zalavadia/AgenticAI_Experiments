            "2. **Heat oil in a pan**: Heat 2 tablespoons of oil (vegetable or canola) in a large pan over medium heat.\n",
            "3. **Sauté onions**: Add the chopped onions to the pan and cook until they're translucent and lightly browned, about 5-7 minutes.\n",
            "4. **Add ginger and garlic**: Add the grated ginger and minced garlic to the pan and cook for another minute, stirring constantly to prevent burning.\n",
            "5. **Add spices**: Stir in the curry powder, cumin, turmeric, and cayenne pepper (if using) and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the spices are fragrant.\n",
            "6. **Add the chicken**: Add the marinated chicken to the pan and cook until it's browned on all sides and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.\n",
            "7. **Add diced tomatoes and broth**: Add the diced tomatoes and chicken broth to the pan, and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer.\n",
            "8. **Reduce heat and let it cook**: Reduce the heat to low and let the curry simmer, covered, for 15-20 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through.\n",
            "9. **Add coconut milk (optional)**: If using coconut milk, stir it in and let the curry simmer for another 5 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened to your liking.\n",
            "10. **Season and serve**: Season the curry with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve over rice, with naan or roti, or with some crusty bread.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. We import the completion function from the litellm library, which is the primary method for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs). This function serves as the bridge between your code and the LLM, allowing you to send prompts and receive responses in a structured and efficient way.\n",
        "\n",
        "    How completion Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Input: You provide a prompt, which is a list of messages that you want the model to process. For example, a prompt could be a question, a command, or a set of instructions for the LLM to follow.\n",
        "    - Output: The completion function returns the model’s response, typically in the form of generated text based on your prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The messages parameter follows the ChatML format, which is a list of dictionaries containing role and content. The role attribute indicates who is “speaking” in the conversation. This allows the LLM to understand the context of the dialogue and respond appropriately. The roles include:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - “system”: Provides the model with initial instructions, rules, or configuration for how it should behave throughout the session. This message is not part of the “conversation” but sets the ground rules or context (e.g., “You will respond in JSON.”).\n",
        "  - “user”: Represents input from the user. This is where you provide your prompts, questions, or instructions.\n",
        "  - “assistant”: Represents responses from the AI model. You can include this role to provide context for a conversation that has already started or to guide the model by showing sample responses. These messages are interpreted as what the “model” said in the passt.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. We specify the model using the provider/model format (e.g., “openai/gpt-4o”)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. The response contains the generated text in choices[0].message.content. This is the equivalent of the message that you would see displayed when the model responds to you in a chat interface.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. **Memory Management**: We can control what the LLM remembers or does not remember by managing what messages go into the conversation. Causing the LLM to forget things can be a powerful tool in some circumstances, such as when we need to break a pattern of poor responses from an Agent."
