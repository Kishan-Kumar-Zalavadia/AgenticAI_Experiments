        "Let’s examine the key improvements this refactoring brings:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. ##Self-Documenting Tools\n",
        "Each tool now carries its own documentation through Python docstrings. The decorator automatically extracts this documentation and uses it as the tool’s description. This means:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Documentation lives with the code it describes\n",
        "- Changes to the function naturally lead to updates in documentation\n",
        "- We get better IDE integration with docstring hints\n",
        "\n",
        "2. ##Automatic Parameter Inference\n",
        "The decorator examines the function’s type hints and signature to automatically build the parameter schema. This means:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Parameter types stay in sync automatically\n",
        "- Required parameters are detected from the function signature\n",
        "- We don’t need to manually maintain a separate schema\n",
        "\n",
        "3. ##Logical Organization Through Tags\n",
        "Tools are now organized with tags that describe their purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "- file_operations for file-related tools\n",
        "- read and list to specify the type of operation\n",
        "- system for administrative functions like termination\n",
        "\n",
        "This tagging system makes it easy to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Group related tools together\n",
        "- Filter tools when creating agents\n",
        "- Understand a tool’s purpose at a glance\n",
        "\n",
        "4. ##Simplified Agent Creation\n",
        "Notice how much simpler our agent creation becomes:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "agent = Agent(\n",
        "    goals=goals,\n",

        "    action_registry=ActionRegistry(tags=[\"file_operations\", \"system\"]),\n",
        "    generate_response=generate_response,\n",
        "    environment=Environment()\n",
        ")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "We no longer need to manually register actions. Instead, we just specify which tags we want, and the ActionRegistry automatically includes the appropriate tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. ##Easier Maintenance\n",
        "When we need to modify our agent’s capabilities, we can:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Add new tools by simply decorating functions\n",
        "- Modify existing tools without touching registration code\n",
        "- Change tool organization by adjusting tags\n",
        "- Remove tools by removing the decorator or changing tags\n",
        "\n",
        "# Understanding the Flow\n",
        "With this refactored version:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. When the code loads, the decorators automatically register all tools in a central registry.\n",
        "2. When we create an ActionRegistry with specific tags, it automatically loads the matching tools.\n",
        "3. The Agent uses these pre-configured tools without any manual registration steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "This automation reduces errors and makes our code more maintainable. If we later want to add new capabilities to our README agent, we simply need to create new functions with the appropriate decorators and tags."
