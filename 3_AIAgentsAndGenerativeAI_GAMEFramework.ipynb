        "The starting point of an agent should be thinking through its design. While much of our focus has been on implementing code, taking a step back to structure an agent’s architecture before writing a single line is crucial. The GAME framework provides a methodology for systematically defining an agent’s goals, actions, memory, and environment, allowing us to approach the design in a logical and modular fashion. By thinking through how these components interact within the agent loop, we can sketch out the agent’s behavior and dependencies before diving into code implementation. This structured approach not only improves clarity but also makes the transition from design to coding significantly smoother and more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "The GAME framework provides a structured way to design AI agents, ensuring modularity and adaptability. It breaks agent design into four essential components:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **G - Goals** / Instructions: What the agent is trying to accomplish and its instructions on how to try to achieve its goals.\n",
        "- **A - Actions**: The tools the agent can use to achieve its goals.\n",
        "- **M - Memory**: How the agent retains information across interactions, which determines what information it will have available in each iteration of the agent loop.\n",
        "- **E - Environment**: The agent’s interface to the external world where it executes actions and gets feedback on the results of those actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Goals and instructions are grouped together under “G” because they work in tandem to shape the agent’s behavior. Goals specify what the agent is trying to achieve, serving as the high-level objectives that define the desired outcomes of the agent’s operation. Instructions, on the other hand, provide the how, detailing the specific steps, strategies, and constraints that guide the agent toward fulfilling its goals effectively. Together, they form the foundation that ensures the agent not only understands its purpose but also follows a structured approach to accomplishing its tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "One important discussion is the relationship between Actions and the Environment. Actions define what the agent can do—they are abstract descriptions of potential choices available to the agent. The Environment, on the other hand, determines how those actions are carried out, providing concrete implementations that execute within the real-world context of the agent. This distinction allows us to separate high-level decision-making from the execution details, making the agent more modular and adaptable.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "You can think of Actions as an “interface” specifying the available capabilities, while the Environment acts as the “implementation” that brings those capabilities to life. For example, an agent might have an action called read_file(), which is simply a placeholder in the Actions layer. The Environment then provides the actual logic, handling file I/O operations and error handling to ensure the action is executed correctly. This separation ensures flexibility—agents can be designed to operate across different environments by simply swapping out implementations while keeping their decision logic intact."

Start by presenting a simple scenario – perhaps a small Python project with just a few files. Watch how the agent approaches the task. Does it immediately jump to reading files, or does it first list the available files to get an overview? These initial decisions reveal a lot about whether your goals and actions enable systematic problem-solving.\n",
        "\n",

With this simple interface, we can create subclasses that implement different memory strategies without changing the core loop.\n",

We can change how we store the memory (e.g., in a database) without changing how we access it in the agent loop.

Most of the time, we are going to use function calling, so the parsing will just be reading the returned tool calls. However, the AgentLanguage can be changed to allow us to also take the same agent and implement it without function calling.\n",

There are also many different ways that we could represent memories to the LLM, from concatenating them into a single string to including them as individual message entries in ChatML. The AgentLanguage allows us to create reusable strategies for handling these concerns and plug them into the agent.\n",

        "  - Agent constructs prompt with goals and available actions\n",
        "  - LLM decides to list files first (logical starting point)\n",

        "  - Memory stores the list of files\n",

        "2. Middle Iterations:\n",
        "  - Agent includes file list in context\n",

        "- Handle different file types by adding new actions\n",

        "- Work with remote files by modifying the environment\n",

        "This example demonstrates how our framework’s separation of concerns makes it easy to create focused, task-specific agents. Each component has a clear responsibility, making the code easy to understand and modify. The GAME architecture lets us think about each aspect of the agent’s behavior independently while ensuring they work together seamlessly.\n",

        "- Implementing smarter memory management\n",
        "- Creating specialized environments\n",
        "- Developing custom agent languages for specific needs\n",
        "\n",
        "The key is that our framework makes these extensions possible without having to change the core agent loop or other components. This modularity is what makes our framework both powerful and practical."
