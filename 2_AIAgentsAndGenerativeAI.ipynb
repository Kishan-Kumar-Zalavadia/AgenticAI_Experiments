Instead of treating function execution as a free-form text generation task, function calling APIs allow us to explicitly define the tools available to the model using JSON Schema.

        "\n",
        "1. No More Custom Parsing Logic - We don’t need to engineer strict text output parsing; the model always returns structured JSON for function calls.\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Execution** - Instead of a rigid loop that manually checks what the agent should do, we simply read and execute the function call.\n",
        "3. **Unified Text & Action Handling** - If no function call is needed, the model responds with a message, allowing mixed conversational and action-driven workflows.\n",
        "4. **Automated Function Execution** - The agent dynamically maps the tool name from the model to its corresponding Python function and executes it with the provided arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Errors Can Still Occur**\n",
        "\n",
        "While function calling improves structured execution, it does not eliminate all potential issues. One common problem is that the model may still sometimes return improperly formatted JSON or a tool call that isn’t valid. For example, the response could contain syntax errors, missing required fields, or incorrectly formatted values. If the agent attempts to parse this malformed JSON, it will fail.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this, we could add error handling around json.loads() to catch json.JSONDecodeError. If a parsing error occurs, the agent retries by sending another request. This prevents the entire loop from crashing and ensures robustness in execution. You can do this as a practice exercise to enhance the agent’s reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, even when the JSON is correctly formatted, errors can still arise at runtime due to missing files, incorrect arguments, or unexpected edge cases in function execution. Our error handling ensures that these issues do not halt execution entirely but instead provide meaningful feedback for debugging and improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Key Takeaways**\n",
        "\n",
        "By leveraging function calling, we remove unnecessary complexity from the agent loop, allowing the AI to interact with its environment more reliably. This simplification makes AI agents more robust, scalable, and easier to integrate into real-world applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a later lesson, we will explore how to register tools dynamically with decorators, further improving flexibility and maintainability in AI agent design."

        "When designing tools for an AI agent, the goal is to provide a limited, well-defined set of functions that are as specific as possible to the agent’s intended task.

Instead, tools should be structured to enforce correctness while minimizing the agent’s margin for error.\n",
        "\n",
        "Agents can use generic tools as well, but more specialized tools are easier to manage and less prone to misuse by the agent. There is a trade-off between the specificity of tools and the flexibility they provide. More specific tools also limit reuse, so finding the right balance is crucial. When building an agent inititally, err on the side of specificity.\n",

For example, in our read_python_file function, if the file does not exist, we can suggest that the agent call the list_python_files function to get an accurate list of file names.\n",

Further, adding it there creates a more complicated set of rules for the agent to remember and may have unexpected side effects on how it handles errors in other tools. By injecting the instruction here, we can ensure that the agent has the information it needs to handle this error without having to remember it in its rules. It also gets the instruction “just in time” when it needs it.\n",
